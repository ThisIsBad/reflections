    See and understand development history. 

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    You have to think more about when to connect but it's worth it.

files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Use git log to print history view over all comits
	Use git diff [ID1] [ID2] to compare versions 1 and 2

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

	It is easier to undo those changes
